A 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor Sentinel limo-style endloader combination car (ambulance conversion) has been outfitted with all of the gear you need for a parapsychologist operation.

Easily accessible equipment is tidily stored on a roof rack:
- **Bio fuel/hydrogen fuel cell system and Main Fuel booster** Enhances fuel range
- **Geophone Ecto Accostic Device** senses Ecto vibrations or demintional shifts
- **Enhanced Paranormal Ecto-kinetic Activity metrer (EPKE meter)** Detects paranormal activity for twelve New York city blocks
- **Fuel/Air scrubbing system** to reduce emissions.
- **Siren** for those urgent client calls.

Importantly, this larger hero vehicle has a roomy interior so that you can easily travel with all of your colleagues, living or otherwise. Interior also features the original ambulance gurney for additional gear, including proton packs. Number of passengers accommodated is quite large. Vehicle has been restored by current seller, including "suspension work and shocks, brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear end... maybe new rings, also mufflers, a little wiring....", and all traces of marshmallow have been removed.

Interested parties are to direct inquiries to Dr. Winston Zeddemore of Manhattan. Complimentary tour of a historic firehouse with the vehicle's sale.
