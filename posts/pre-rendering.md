Evolved from a run of the mill people carrier, this van has several modifications included.

- **Pontoons** so that the vehicle can be transformed into a boat when needed.
- **Submarine** capabilities have been enabled for Arctic temperatures.
- **Ramps** formed from single panel doors.
- **Missles** that are roof mounted for 360 degree range.
- **Blaster seat** for targeted battle with enemies.

Importantly, this larger hero vehicle lets you **choose** which modifications to use for each crime fighting situation. Number of passengers accommodated is quite large. Vehicle has been detailed, and all pizza smells removed.

Interested parties are to direct inquiries to Donatello.
